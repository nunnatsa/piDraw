# PiHATDraw
RasberyPi HAT is a device that is connected to a raspberry Pi and includes several additional hardware. It includes a 8X8 LED display and a joistic.

This software should run on a raspberry pi with a hat. It uses the hat to draw: the display is a virtual window - a subset of the bigger canvas. To draw, move the cursor to the required pixel and press he joystick to set the pixel.

The software also starts a web application that serves a HTML page to display the full draw.
